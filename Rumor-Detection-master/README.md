# Rumor-Detection
Rumors   spreading   widely   on   social   media   havehad  far-reaching  consequences  in  both  the  online  and  offline worlds.  The  effects  of  rumor  propagation  are  dreadful  in  time-critical  events,  such  as  during  natural  disasters.  With  so  much unconfirmed data, it is unavoidable that there will be gossip in the environment. As a result, efficient rumor detection is an essential and  trendy  topic.  The  identification  of  rumors  in  online  social media  is  represented  as  a  classification  problem  in  this  paper, and  the  success  of  supervised  machine  learning  algorithms  is evaluated  in  real  data.  To  address  this  problem,  we  proposed a  text  classification  model  using  the  BERT  model  and  applied it  to  three  datasets:  LIAR,  LIAR-PLUS,  and  ISOT  dataset  and compared  the  results.  Our  model  performed  best  on  the  ISOT dataset and achieved 96% accuracy. For LIAR and LIAR-PLUS,our  model  achieved  the  accuracy  of  68%  and  70%.
